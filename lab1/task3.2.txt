1) What is a channel? What is an interface and how are they related to each other?

	A channel is a container class for communication and synchronization. It provides and implements one or more interfaces. 

	A interface specifies a set of access methods of the channel. 

2) How do channels, interfaces and ports interact to provide communication? Illustrate with a figure.

	 Modules contain Ports
	 Channels provide Interfaces
	 Ports bound to Interfaces

3) What are virtual methods and what are they used for?

	A pure virtual method by definition is a method that will only be implemented inside a derived class from the abstract base class. It has no implementation at all. 

	For being redefined. 


4) What is the difference between primitive and hierarchical channels? Explain how to choose when to use one or the other.

5) What is the difference between a module and a hierarchical channel?






6) Where are a primitive and a hierarchical channel derived from?






7) What is a sensitivity list? Explain the difference between static and dynamic sensitivity.

	The sensitivity list is a list of signals. A change in value on one or more of these signals, causes the process to be activated:

	Static sensitivity list is declared when a process is registered with the kernel.
	
	Dynamic sensitivity list. For example, for threads, the sensitivity may change each time wait() is called.


8) What are events and what is their purpose?

	Flexible, low-level synchronization primitive
	Used to construct other forms of synchronization

	Processes are triggered by events.
